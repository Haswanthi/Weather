#Weather Display Website
I have meticulously crafted a comprehensive website utilizing a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RapidAPI, and Bootstrap. 
This fully operational platform adeptly exhibits weather attributes for diverse cities upon user query, seamlessly defaulting to Hyderabad's weather when no city is specified. 
Furthermore, in instances where the entered city is absent from the database, the system adeptly handles such situations by indicating that the parameters remain undefined.
